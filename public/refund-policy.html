        <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 2025</p>

        <h2>1. No Refunds on Alcohol</h2>
        <p><strong>All alcohol sales are final.</strong> Due to Texas law and health & safety regulations, we cannot accept returns or provide refunds for alcoholic beverages once they leave our control, except where required by law.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>No refunds on wine, beer, spirits, or any alcoholic product once picked up or delivered.</li>
            <li>No exchanges for taste preferences.</li>
            <li>No returns for opened or unopened alcohol, unless the product is defective or recalled by the manufacturer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Failed Delivery Due to ID or Age</h2>
        <p>Alcohol can only be delivered to a person who is 21+ with a valid, government-issued photo ID.</p>
        <p>If the driver cannot complete the delivery because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No one 21+ is present at the delivery address, or</li>
            <li>The person receiving cannot provide a valid government-issued photo ID, or</li>
            <li>The delivery address is in a restricted or dry area,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The order may be cancelled at the driver's or store's discretion.</li>
            <li>Delivery fees may <strong>not</strong> be refunded.</li>
            <li>Alcohol will be returned to the store and no refund will be issued, except where required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Non-Alcohol Items</h2>
        <p>For non-alcohol items (such as merchandise, accessories, etc.):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Returns may be accepted at the store's discretion within 7 days of purchase.</li>
            <li>Items must be unused, in original packaging, and with receipt.</li>
            <li>Refunds, if approved, will be issued to the original payment method.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Order Cancellations</h2>
        <p>Once an order is placed and confirmed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orders for alcohol cannot be cancelled after preparation begins or the driver has been dispatched.</li>
            <li>Pickup orders may be cancelled before preparation begins by calling the store directly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Incorrect or Damaged Items</h2>
        <p>If you receive the wrong item or a visibly damaged product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact us immediately at (210)-541-0594 or info@fiestaliquor.com.</li>
            <li>We will review the issue and may offer a replacement or store credit at our discretion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
        <p>If you believe there is an error with your charge, please contact us first so we can review and resolve the issue quickly. Unnecessary chargebacks may be contested with your bank or card issuer.</p>

        <h2>7. Texas Delivery Rules</h2>
        <p>Alcohol delivery is subject to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code and local laws. We comply with all applicable delivery restrictions, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliveries only during legal hours for alcohol sales.</li>
            <li>No delivery to dry areas or locations where alcohol delivery is prohibited.</li>
