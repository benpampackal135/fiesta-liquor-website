## Default Admin Account

- Admin access is now controlled by `ADMIN_EMAILS` in your `.env` file.
- Example: `ADMIN_EMAILS=bensonpampackal456@gmail.com,manager@fiestaliquor.com`
- Local email/password customers can still be created through normal auth routes.

**Important:** Restrict production origins with `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env`.

## 💾 Data Storage (Simple & Automatic)

All data is stored in JSON files (like a simple database):
- `data/products.json` - Your product catalog
- `data/users.json` - Customer accounts
- `data/orders.json` - All orders

**These files are created automatically** - you don't need to do anything!

**Backup Tip:** Just copy the `data/` folder to backup all your products, customers, and orders.

## 🎯 How It Works (Simple!)

- **You manage everything through your web browser** - no code editing needed
- Products, prices, and inventory sync automatically
- Orders are saved automatically
- Everything works like a simple platform (Shopify/Square style)

**You don't need to know coding!** Just:
1. Log in to admin dashboard
2. Click buttons to manage products
3. Upload CSV files to bulk import
4. Edit products to update prices/stock

That's it! 🎉

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. Change `JWT_SECRET` to a strong, random secret
2. Update Stripe keys to production keys
3. Change default admin password
4. Consider using a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) instead of JSON files
5. Add environment-specific configurations
6. Set up proper error logging and monitoring
7. Enable HTTPS
8. Configure CORS properly for your domain
