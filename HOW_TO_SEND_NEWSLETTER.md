## Email Newsletter Best Practices

### Subject Lines That Work
✅ "🎉 Exclusive Deal Just for You - 20% Off!"
✅ "New Arrivals This Week at Fiesta Liquor"
✅ "Limited Time: Holiday Special Inside"
✅ "Your Weekly Deals Newsletter 🍾"

❌ "Newsletter" (too generic)
❌ "Click here now!!!" (looks like spam)
❌ All caps subject lines

### Email Content Tips
1. **Start with a greeting**: "Hey there!" or "Happy Friday!"
2. **Lead with value**: Share the best deal first
3. **Use images**: Show your products
4. **Include clear CTA**: "Shop Now" button
5. **Add unsubscribe link**: Required by law

### Example Newsletter Structure
```
Subject: 🍾 Weekend Special: 15% Off Premium Wines
